summary: Combining constituency mean age, leave vote, change in Labour vote share and swing from Labour to Conservative in three-dimensional scatter graphs.![3d thumbnail](/plotly_ge_meanage_eu_vs_small.jpg#r)

These two graphs represent my first attempt to produce three-dimensional graphs. The figures can be rotated and enlarged using a mouse. The first one combines seat mean age, leave vote and change in Labour vote share and in the second, change in Labour vote share is replaced by swing from Labour to Conservative. They should definitely be viewed in full page view.
