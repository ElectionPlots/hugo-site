Welcome to UK Election Graphs. This site was created in order to document my attempts to make sense of Labour's crushing defeat in the 2019 general election. In order to do this I am using the Python programming language for the first time. Not only am I not a Python programmer but I'm also not a professional data scientist so I welcome comments and corrections. I am making the code, data and data sources available for every graph that I publish. I am open to suggestions for future graphs and I am also willing to publish graphs submitted by others as long as the code and data is supplied.
