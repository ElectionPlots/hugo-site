Welcome to UK Election Graphs. This site was created in order to document my attempts to make sense of Labour's crushing defeat in the 2019 general election. My initial focus is to look for patterns and correlations between the election results at the constituency level and statistical data for constituencies available from the [House of Commons Library(https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/). 

I am not a professional data scientist so I welcome comments and corrections. I am making the code, data and data sources available for every graph that I publish on this site. I am open to suggestions for future graphs and am also willing to publish graphs submitted by others as long as the code and data is supplied.
